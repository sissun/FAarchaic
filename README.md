## Abstract
Facial approximation (FA) is a common tool used to recreate the possible facial appearance of a deceased person based on the relationship between soft tissue and the skull. Although this technique has been primarily applied to modern humans in the realm of forensic science and archaeology, only a few studies have attempted to produce FAs for archaic humans. This study presented a computerized FA approach for archaic humans based on the assumption that the facial soft tissue thickness depths (FSTDs) of modern living humans are similar to those of archaic humans. Additionally, we employed geometric morphometrics (GM) to examine the geometric morphological variations between the approximated faces and modern human faces. Our method has been applied to the Jinniushan (JNS) 1 archaic human, which is one of the most important fossils of the Middle Pleistocene, dating back to approximately 260,000 BP. The overall shape of the approximated face has a relatively lower forehead and robust eyebrows; a protruding, wider, and elongated middle and upper face; and a broad and short nose. Results also indicate skull morphology and the distribution of FSTDs influence the approximated face. These experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can approximate a plausible and reproducible face of an archaic human.
